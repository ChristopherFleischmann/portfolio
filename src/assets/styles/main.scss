/*
    Base
    For anything defined by HTML including <body>, <p> and <a>.
    Also defined in this directory are variables, non-rendering
    sass like mixins and functions and resets.
 */
@import 'base/base';


/*
    Components
    Stylesheets for modular UI items like .button, .alert or
    .badge. Each stylesheet should represent an independent
    object.
 */
@import 'components/components';



/*
    Patterns
    Stylesheets for larger objects with children that they
    affect. An example would be .hero-header with
    .hero-header__title and .hero-header__description.
 */
@import 'patterns/patterns';


/*
    Views
    This directory is for styles specific to a single view
    that affect multiple patterns within them. For instance,
    if a pattern has slightly different styling when it appears
    on the homepage, those differences would be described here.
